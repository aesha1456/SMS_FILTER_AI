# SMS Spam Filter

A robust and production-ready SMS classification system built with **FastAPI** and **Docker**, capable of distinguishing between **Transactional**, **Promotional**, and **Spam** messages. The system combines **machine learning classification** with **rule-based logic** (whitelisting and suspicious domain detection) for maximum accuracy and minimal false positives.

## 🧩 Core Components

1. **Filter Engine** (`src/filter_engine.py`)

   * Extracts domains from messages
   * Compares against trusted whitelist
   * Runs ML-based classification (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
   * Detects known malicious domains

2. **API Layer** (`main.py`)

   * Exposes `/check-sms` endpoint
   * Handles request validation and error responses
   * Outputs structured JSON verdicts

3. **Configuration** (`config/whitelist.json`)

   * Stores safe domains (e.g., *amazon.in, flipkart.com*)
   * Stores safe phrases (e.g., *“your otp is”*)
   * Editable without touching code

---

## 🔍 Data Flow

```
Incoming SMS → Extract Domains → Check Whitelist → AI Model → Suspicious Domain Check → Final Verdict
```

---

## 📜 Logging

Logs (`logs/app.log`) capture:

* Timestamp of request
* Message category & confidence score
* Whitelist/blacklist matches
* Processing time

---

## 🔒 Security Highlights

* Input validation prevents malformed requests
* No storage of sensitive SMS data
* Configurable whitelist/blacklist
* Domain-based filtering for known scams
* Ready for rate limiting / middleware protection

---

## ✅ Whitelisting

**Domain-based** and **phrase-based** logic ensures legitimate services are never flagged.

Example entries in `whitelist.json`:

```json
{
  "domains": ["amazon.in", "flipkart.com", "paytm.com"],
  "phrases": ["your otp is", "transaction successful", "booking confirmed"]
}
```

Example messages:

* `"Your OTP is 456789"` → Always Transactional (phrase match)
* `"Check offers at https://amazon.in/deals"` → Always Promotional (domain match)

---

## 🚨 Suspicious Domain Detection

Embedded blacklist inside `filter_engine.py`:

```python
SUSPICIOUS_DOMAINS = [
    "fakewebsite.com",
    "verify-now.online",
    "login-now-security.xyz"
]
```

Messages containing these are **immediately blocked** with high confidence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker build -t sms-spam-filter .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name sms-filter sms-spam-filter
```

### Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🔍 Real API Examples

**Promotional (Whitelisted Domain):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check-sms" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Big sale today at https://trip.com"}'
```

Response:

```json
{"verdict": "allowed", "reason": "whitelisted"}
```

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check-sms" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Win cash now at https://fakewebsite.com"}'
```

Response:

```json
{"verdict": "blocked", "reason": "suspicious_domain", "matched_domain": "fakewebsite.com"}
```

**Transactional (Whitelisted Phrase):**

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check-sms" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Your OTP is 987654"}'
```

Response:

```json
{"verdict": "allowed", "reason": "whitelisted"}
```

---

## 🔧 Load Testing

Sample Locust script (`locustfile.py`):

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task
import random

class SMSUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def classify_sms(self):
        msgs = [
            "Your OTP is 123456",
            "Win iPhone! Visit https://fakewebsite.com",
            "50% OFF today at trip.com"
        ]
        self.client.post("/check-sms", json={"message": random.choice(msgs)})
```

Run test:

```bash
locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000 -u 100 -r 10
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Live retraining from incoming traffic
* Multilingual SMS support
* Admin panel for whitelist/blacklist management
* Analytics dashboard for spam trends
* Webhook integrations for real-time alerts

---

## 🏁 Summary
